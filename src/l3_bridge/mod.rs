//! L3 bridge: root crate owns L1→L3 integration.
//!
//! This module is the seam between the root crate (which owns the L1 ring,
//! UIA / DXGI hooks, napi addon entry points, and all `windows-rs`
//! dependencies) and the `engine-perception` crate (a pure timely +
//! differential-dataflow compute crate, deliberately kept napi-free).
//!
//! ## Why the bridge lives in root, not in engine-perception
//!
//! Codex review v2 P1 rejected the alternative direction
//! (`engine-perception → desktop-touch-engine` dep). Putting the dep
//! the other way around would have pulled napi, ORT, tokenizers, and
//! `windows-rs` into engine-perception's transitive graph and broken
//! the contract from `docs/adr-008-d1-plan.md` §2 ("`engine-perception`
//! is napi-free / pure Rust"). The L1 ring is owned by the root crate,
//! so the natural place for the decode→push adapter is also the root
//! crate. See `docs/adr-007-p5c-plan.md` §2.2 / §6 / §12 for the full
//! rationale.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! D1-2 (ADR-008) lands `focus_pump` here. The pump owns a parent-side
//! `EventRing::subscribe(...)` (Codex v3 P1 — registers the slot
//! before spawning the worker so a sync push immediately after
//! `spawn()` is delivered) and forwards `UiaFocusChanged` payloads
//! into a `dyn engine_perception::input::L1Sink`.
//!
//! Future submodules (D2):
//!   - `dirty_rect_pump` (P5c-2 / DXGI dirty rects)
//!   - `window_pump` (P5c-3 / window opened/closed/foreground)
//!   - `scroll_pump` (P5c-4 / IUIAutomationScrollPattern)

// ─── Production pipeline lifecycle (D2-0, ADR-008) ────────────────────────
//
// Mirrors the L1 ring's slot pattern (`L1_SLOT: OnceLock<Mutex<Option<
// Arc<L1Inner>>>>`, `src/l1_capture/worker.rs:227`) so callers get the
// same shutdown / restart semantics as the L1 layer.
//
// ## Why the slot is an `Arc<PerceptionPipeline>` and not a `Box`
//
// Codex review v3 P2-2: a future caller may hold an `Arc` clone past
// our shutdown (e.g. a long-running napi binding holding the view).
// `&self`-based `shutdown_with_timeout` lets us stop the internal
// threads without consuming the value, so outstanding clones that
// only read from the view handle stay valid (read paths don't depend
// on the worker thread).
//
// ## Why pump / worker live behind `Mutex<Option<...>>`
//
// `PerceptionWorker::shutdown(self, timeout)` and
// `FocusPump::shutdown(self, timeout)` are both **consume-on-shutdown**
// — they take `self`. To call them from `&self`, we hold each behind a
// `Mutex<Option<T>>` and `take()` the value before shutdown. The
// existing `is_finished()` + deadline polling lives **inside** those
// `shutdown` impls (`engine_perception::input::PerceptionWorker::shutdown`
// at `crates/engine-perception/src/input.rs:218-241`,
// `FocusPump::shutdown` mirroring it), so we just split the timeout
// budget half-and-half across pump and worker and delegate.
//
// ## Slot-clear protocol (Codex v4 P1-6, North-Star)
//
// `shutdown_perception_pipeline_for_test` MUST clear the slot only on
// success and only after `Arc::ptr_eq` confirms the slot still holds
// the same instance we shut down. The L1 layer landed this exact
// invariant in `worker.rs:267-292` (Codex PR #86 P2). We follow the
// same shape so a concurrent `ensure_perception_pipeline()` that
// re-init'd the slot mid-shutdown does not get its fresh instance
// orphaned.

/// Production-lifecycle bundle. `view` / `handle` are clone-cheap
/// read/write surfaces; `worker` and `pump` own retain-on-timeout
/// JoinHandles internally (each via its own `Mutex<Option<JoinHandle>>`),
/// so `shutdown_with_timeout(&self, ...)` can poll without consuming
/// either side.
///
/// ## Why `worker` / `pump` are NOT wrapped in `Mutex<Option<...>>` here
///
/// An earlier draft wrapped each in `Mutex<Option<PerceptionWorker>>` /
/// `Mutex<Option<FocusPump>>` and `take()`-ed before calling their
/// consume-form `shutdown(self, timeout)`. Codex review v6 P1
/// flagged that as unsound: a single failed `shutdown` would replace
/// the leg with `None`, so a later retry could observe `None` and
/// return `Ok(())` while the timed-out thread was still alive. That
/// would let `ensure_perception_pipeline()` spawn a duplicate worker
/// after `shutdown_perception_pipeline_for_test` cleared the slot.
///
/// Fix: push the retain-on-timeout invariant down into
/// `PerceptionWorker` and `FocusPump` themselves (each holds a
/// `Mutex<Option<JoinHandle<()>>>` and exposes
/// `shutdown_with_timeout(&self, ...)`). The pipeline can then store
/// them as plain fields and delegate `shutdown_with_timeout` directly.
