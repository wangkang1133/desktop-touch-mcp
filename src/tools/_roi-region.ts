/**
 * _roi-region.ts — ADR-024 Seed-2 S3b — window-rect intersection filter (OQ-11c).
 *
 * Converts the per-output DXGI dirty rects surfaced by S3a
 * (`VisualMotionObservation.dirtyRects`, screen-absolute / per-output) into
 * **window-relative** ROI rects:
 *
 *   1. Intersect each dirty rect with the target window rect.
 *   2. Drop rects that miss the window entirely — DXGI dirty rects are
 *      reported per *output* (whole monitor), so a single poll can carry dirty
 *      regions belonging to other windows, the mouse cursor, or notifications
 *      sharing the same monitor. Those must not leak into the act's ROI crop.
 *   3. Translate the survivors into window-origin-relative coordinates
 *      (subtract `windowRect.x` / `windowRect.y`) so they line up with the
 *      `roiCapture.roi` / `somImage` crop space (a window-relative rect, per
 *      the S1 contract `RoiCapture.roi`).
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free. **No production consumer yet**: the act-response
 * fold (S5) calls this to build `roiCapture.roi` after the ROI-aware OCR (S4)
 * produces the entity preview. S3b ships + unit-tests the geometry in
 * isolation so the per-output→window coordinate/sign conversion is reviewable
 * on its own (sub-plan §2 S3b review axis).
 *
 * Sub-plan: `desktop-touch-mcp-internal@…:docs/adr-024-seed2-plan.md` §2 S3b.
