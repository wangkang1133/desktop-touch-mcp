/**
 * ADR-018 destination-explicit input pipeline — Phase 1b dispatcher skeleton.
 *
 * Resolves an `InputDestination` (4-discriminator union per ADR §2.3) and
 * dispatches scroll wheel actions through the appropriate tier. Phase 1b
 * implements Tier 1 (UIA `IUIAutomationScrollPattern::SetScrollPercent` via
 * the new napi export `uiaScrollByWheelAtHwnd`); Tier 2 (CDP) lands in
 * Phase 3, Tier 3 (PostMessage WM_MOUSEWHEEL) in Phase 4. Tier 4 (legacy
 * nutjs SendInput) remains in `mouse.ts:scrollHandler` and is invoked by
 * the caller when `dispatchScrollWheel` returns `null` (Phase 1b fall-through
 * path; Phase 4 tightens this to `dest.kind === 'unresolved'` only when
 * Tier 3 PostMessage covers resolved-but-non-UIA destinations).
 *
 * See `docs/adr-018-phase-1b-subplan.md` for the Phase 1b interpretation of
 * §2.6.2 path-(b) (lenient Tier 4 guard during 1b → strict in Phase 4).
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §3.1 (multi-table fact integrity): the `reason` values emitted
 * here mirror the `reason?:` union of `ScrollVerifyOutcome` in
 * `src/tools/mouse.ts` and `docs/adr-018-input-pipeline-3tier.md` §2.6.2.
 * The `Channel` type below is the ADR §2.6.1 canonical 4-value enum that the
 * *dispatcher* emits via `DispatchOutcome.channel` (Phase 1b emits only
 * `'uia'`). NOTE: `mouse.ts:scrollHandler` additionally emits the legacy
 * literal `'wheel_send_input'` for its Tier 4 nutjs path — that literal is
 * scrollHandler-local and is folded into this `Channel` enum as `'send_input'`
 * by the Phase 4 §2.6.3 migration. Any rename must sweep all surfaces.

 * "Chrome_WidgetWin"` shape over-matched `Chrome_WidgetWin_0` (Chromium
 * **sub-windows** — popup menus, dropdowns) which can never be a scroll
 * destination, so the gate is now an equality on the top-level class only.
 *
 * **Known carry-over (Electron / multi-Chromium-app desktops)**: Chrome /
 * Edge / Slack / VS Code / Discord / Teams all use the same class name for
 * their top-level windows because they share the Chromium frame. When the
 * user has Chrome running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` AND scrolls a
 * different Chromium-shell app (Slack, VS Code), the gate matches and the
 * `listTabsLight` probe succeeds — the wheel then mis-routes to Chrome.
 * Phase 3 accepts this risk because:
 *   1. Other Chromium-shell apps rarely run with a public CDP port (they
 *      don't expose `--remote-debugging-port` by default).
 *   2. When they do, the user has opted into CDP control and the
 *      destination ambiguity is theirs to manage (e.g. distinct ports).
 *   3. Phase 5 will tighten by cross-checking the HWND's PID against the

 *      Phase 3 to avoid scope creep. ADR §7 OQ3 / OQ6 carry-over.
