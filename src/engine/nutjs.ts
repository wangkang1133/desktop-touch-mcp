// libnut — the native key-injection backend that @nut-tree-fork/nut-js wraps
// — is not safe for concurrent SendInput invocations. Two awaited
// `keyboard.pressKey(...)` calls can yield between the press and release of
// the same key list, leaving libnut's internal modifier-state tracking in an
// undefined condition that segfaults the Node process and tears down the
// MCP server (issue #255). The race window is wide enough that the natural
// chord pattern `keyboard({press:"alt+i"})` then `keyboard({press:"m"})`
// fired in the same Claude turn hit it reliably.
//
// The lock is applied at the engine layer (not at the keyboard tool entry)
// because `scroll`, `terminal`, and `clipboard` tools all reach into the
// same libnut backend via `keyboard.pressKey` / `releaseKey` / `type`. A
// keyboard-tool-only lock would still crash when the LLM interleaves a
// `keyboard` call with a `scroll` PageDown or a `terminal` Enter. Wrapping
// the engine export catches every current and future caller in one place.
//
// The queue tail tracks the completion *point* of the in-flight call so a
// rejection does not poison the queue: the next caller sees a resolved
// tail regardless of how the prior call ended.

// `keyboard(action='sequence')` needs to execute N steps without letting any
// other keyboard caller splice between a step's press and release. The
// per-call locking applied to `keyboard.pressKey/releaseKey` above is
// insufficient: it only protects each call individually, so a concurrent
// caller can still grab the lock between this sequence's step boundaries
// (and especially during the `holdMs` window of a held step), producing
// a phantom chord against the wrong target.
//
// The fix is an *outer* lock that the sequence handler takes around the
// whole step loop. Inside that lock the handler MUST NOT call the wrapped
// `keyboard.pressKey/releaseKey` (they would deadlock on the same
// `_inputQueueTail` chain). The `rawKeyboard` primitives below bypass the
// wrapper for use *inside* `withKeyboardLock(...)` only.

 * `rawKeyboard.*` primitives below — calling the wrapped `keyboard.pressKey`
 * here would deadlock on the same `_inputQueueTail` chain.
 *
 * Failure-safe: same `.then(fn, fn)` pattern as `withInputLock`, so an
