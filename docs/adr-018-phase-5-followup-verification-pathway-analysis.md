## 1. Why this document exists

PR #308 closed with a chain-trust assertion and a documented Codex P1 trade-off (boundary case → false-positive `delivered`). A follow-up "robust verification" effort was scoped against 3 candidate paths (A: UIA + phase correlation / B: existing MAE port / C: pHash 32×32). Opus recommended **B** on the grounds of "reuse existing helpers, low cost, ~100-150 lines, no new Rust dep."

The user pushed back: **the question wasn't "smallest delta" — it was "what raises overall system detection capability across the MCP surface."** This document re-evaluates A/B/C against that broader north star.

---

## 2. North star (re-statement)

ADR-018 §1.3 frames the underlying problem as:

> Without this fix, every user with a stay-resident accessibility / display-management tool (Dell DDPM, Logitech Options+, NVIDIA Game Filter, MS PowerToys FancyZones, AutoHotKey scripts, RDP shadow sessions) sees scroll silently degrade to a no-op. This is the most-used class of tool in the MCP surface and the silent-failure mode is unrecoverable from the LLM side — `ok:true` masks a 0-px scroll.

Restated as design invariants:

1. **Destination-explicit IO** — HWND on the wire end-to-end, no cursor-pixel routing.
2. **Honest observation per tier** — observation must NEVER silently degrade into a false-positive `delivered`. The LLM side must be able to act on the reported delivery status.
3. **Generality across custom-paint apps** — Excel cell grid is one instance of a class: Word `_WwG`, PowerPoint slide canvas, OneNote canvas, Photoshop/Blender custom controls, GPU-rendered games, RDP shadow surfaces. The solution must scale to that class, not bolt one-off heuristics per app.
4. **System-wide, not just scroll** — the same observation primitive should ideally serve click verification (`mouse_click.verifyDelivery`), keyboard input verification (`keyboard` BG `BackgroundInputNotDelivered`), and `desktop_act` post-state — wherever the MCP layer needs to confirm "did the user-visible state change."

Path B's strongest argument ("re-use existing helpers") is a code-organisation virtue. It is **silent on whether the resulting capability lifts the north star vs. encoding a one-off Excel scroll patch.** The pushback is that we picked the path with the lowest LOC, not the path that builds the right shared primitive for the next 12 months of verification work.

---

## 3. Capability surface — what each path produces

| Path | Primitive produced | Output shape | Re-usable for | Re-usable for | Re-usable for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | scroll | click verify | keyboard verify |
| **A** | (a) UIA `ScrollPattern.VerticalScrollPercent` pre/post; (b) phase correlation `(dx, dy)` shift vector | structured: numeric percent OR a 2D shift in pixels | ✓ canonical | ✓ click → focus shift → repaint detected as small (dx,dy) | ✓ keyboard type → text repaints in field → repaint detected |
| **B** | (a) `computeChangeFraction` (boolean over 1% threshold); (b) `findNewRows`/`findNewColumns` MAE search returning row-count | unstructured: "did it change a lot" + scroll-row count | ✓ for scroll-overlap (its design target) | △ "did anything change" but no localisation | △ same — no localisation |
| **C** | pHash 32×32 Hamming distance | unstructured: bits-different scalar | ✓ generic delta detector | ✓ same | ✓ same |

**Phase correlation in A returns a *vector*.** That's a structured signal that other tiers can consume: did the page move down by 50 px? was there only a 1 px drift (anti-aliasing)? did the focus rectangle move sideways (focus shift)? `computeChangeFraction` returns "did >1% of blocks change." That answers a yes/no, not a "what changed how."

**UIA `ScrollPattern.VerticalScrollPercent` is the canonical accessibility API observation.** When the app exposes it, it gives an exact numeric percent — by definition the most reliable observation channel. ADR-018 Tier 1 already uses it for *dispatch*; using it symmetrically for *observation* is the natural design (and was originally listed as the Tier 1 observation in ADR-018 §2.2).

---

## 4. Empirical risk re-check on path B

Opus's path-B recommendation rested on this claim:

> 0.36% raw-byte change on a 1422400-byte buffer ≈ 5120 changed bytes ≈ thousands of changed blocks — orders of magnitude above the existing 2-5% block-fraction thresholds.

This is true only **if the 5120 byte changes are distributed across many 8×8 blocks**. The empirical data was:

```
pre[0:60]  = 525252ff 525252ff 525252ff … (dark-gray row-label strip)
post[0:60] = 525252ff 525252ff 525252ff …
byte diff: 5120 / 1422400 ( 0.36 %)
```

A 1422400-byte buffer at 4 channels × 889 width × 400 height = 4 × 8 × 8 = 256 bytes per 8×8 block. That gives 1422400 / 256 ≈ **5556 blocks**. If the 5120 byte changes are concentrated (e.g., in the thin row-number column on the left edge, ~30 px wide × 400 tall × 4 channels = ~48000 bytes total — even all-pixels-changed there is at most 48000 bytes), they'd live in roughly 30/889 ≈ 3.4% of blocks horizontally × 100% vertically = ~190 affected blocks.

- 5120 changed bytes across 190 blocks ≈ 27 bytes per block average — **above** `NOISE_THRESHOLD=16` per block, so those blocks WOULD register.
- Path B might work. **But Opus's calculation didn't account for spatial concentration**, and the threshold (NOISE_THRESHOLD=16 *per channel*) interacts with the 4-channel layout in a way that needs verification.

The honest answer is: **B might work empirically — but it hasn't been verified, and its detection ceiling is "did something move", not "what moved by how much."**

Path A's UIA pre-snapshot is empirically known to be exact when the pattern is exposed. Path A's phase correlation gives sub-pixel `(dx, dy)` regardless of content. **Neither requires the empirical verification step B does.**

---

## 5. Cost re-evaluation (LOC ≠ value)

| Path | LOC | New crate | Days | Capability ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | ~200-300 (Rust + TS) | `rustfft` | 3-5 | (dx,dy) vector + UIA percent — structured, generalises |
| B | ~100-150 (TS) | none | 1 | "did >1% change" + scroll row count — unstructured |
| C | ~50 (Rust + TS) | `image_hasher` | 1 | "did pHash diff exceed bits-threshold" — unstructured |

Opus weighted **LOC × time** heavily; the user's frame is **capability × longevity**. A's 200 lines build a primitive that the rest of the MCP can lean on for the next 12 months. B's 100 lines is glue specific to one PostMessage path.

ADR-018 itself (§1.3) is a single ADR that spent ~6 weeks of trunk land + 7 sub-plan PRs. The cost of one more ~5-day PR to install a foundational primitive is small relative to the system-wide debt it pays down.

---

## 6. Re-evaluation against decision criteria

| Criterion | A (UIA + phase correlation) | B (MAE port) | C (pHash 32×32) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empirical Excel robustness | UIA path: exact when exposed; phase correlation: sub-pixel shift regardless | Block-SAD: spatial-concentration-dependent (unverified) | Aliases on periodic grid (per Hacker Factor / pHash discussions) |
| Generalisation to Word `_WwG` / PowerPoint / OneNote / RDP / games | ✓ phase correlation is content-agnostic | △ scroll-row MAE is scroll-specific | △ same hash, same alias risk per app |
| Re-use as click / keyboard verify primitive | ✓ phase correlation gives (dx,dy) shift for any visual state change | △ "did it change >1%" — useful but coarse | △ "did pHash differ" — coarse |
| Engineering cost | high (200-300 lines, new dep, 3-5 days) | low (100-150 lines, no dep, 1 day) | very low (50 lines, new dep, 1 day) |
| Maintenance burden | rustfft is stable, pure-Rust SIMD | none (existing helpers) | image_hasher is maintained but external |
| Risk: false positive on caret blink / Excel marching-ants | phase correlation: peak amplitude < threshold filters these out | block-SAD: HIGH (every block-change counts) | pHash: HIGH (any bit-flip counts) |
| Risk: false negative on Excel | UIA: zero if exposed; phase correlation: very low (frequency-domain shift detect) | spatial-concentration-dependent (unverified) | structural alias on periodic grid |
| PR scope discipline | one PR feasible (helper + tests + docs) | one PR feasible (smaller) | one PR feasible (smallest) |
| Aligned with ADR-018 north star (§1.3, §2.2, §2.3) | ✓ destination-explicit, honest, generalises | △ honest (boundary still wrong), partial generalisation | △ same |

---

## 7. Verdict under the north-star lens

**Path A is correct when the goal is system-wide detection-capability lift.** Path B is correct when the goal is "fix Excel scroll observation with minimum delta." The user's framing is the former — therefore A.

Concretely:

1. **UIA pre/post `ScrollPattern.VerticalScrollPercent`** lifts the Tier 1 observation surface — symmetric with the Tier 1 dispatch path that already exists. When Excel/Word/PowerPoint expose the pattern, the dispatcher gets an exact percent.
2. **Phase correlation (FFT via `rustfft`)** lifts the Tier 3+4 fallback observation surface — content-agnostic, gives a structured (dx,dy) shift vector. The same primitive serves:
   - Tier 3 `PostMessage` chain-trust verification (the immediate use case)
   - Future `mouse_click.verifyDelivery` "did the click cause a visible focus/repaint shift" — a known gap in the current heuristic
   - Future `keyboard` BG verification when UIA TextPattern read-back is unavailable
   - Future `desktop_act` post-state verification

Path B remains valuable as a **fall-back tier** when neither UIA nor phase correlation produce a confident signal (e.g., capture failure, FFT cost prohibitive on a hot path). But it is not the primary primitive — it's the existing 8×8 block-SAD already in the codebase.

Path C is **superseded**: pHash 32×32's structural alias on periodic grids is the same failure mode that motivated this work. The "smallest delta" virtue isn't enough to justify replacing the existing dHash without solving the periodic-grid problem.

---

## 8. Round 2 — User review findings (2026-05-16)

The Round 1 verdict (Path A as a pair of "UIA pre/post + phase correlation") was reviewed and pushed back on. Verbatim findings:

- **P1 — phase correlation 過信** — "Excel のような周期格子、低テクスチャ、行ヘッダだけ変わるケースではピークが曖昧になり得ます。`peak amplitude > 0.05` だけでなく、`peak / secondPeak`、軸方向の符号、タイルごとの一致率、低テクスチャ判定を入れる前提にした方が安全です。"
- **P1 — click / keyboard verification への一般化が広すぎる** — "スクロールの『平行移動検知』と、クリック/入力の『局所 repaint 検知』を同じ primitive で扱っています。クリックや文字入力は全体 shift が 0 のことが多いので、phase correlation は主役ではなく `motion vector + dirty/residual map` の一要素にした方がよいです。"
- **P2 — multi-frame temporal が中心になっていない** — "pre/post 1 組の検知に寄っています。今回の本丸はむしろここで、`t=0, 50, 100, 200 ms` のような低周波 multi-frame ring buffer を持ち、N フレーム内の最大変化/安定後変化を見る設計にすると、かなり北極星っぽくなります。"
- **P2 — UIA 観測 API の実装形が ADR で曖昧** — "PostMessage 後の leaf HWND に対して『read-only に percent を取る』公開 API としては ADR 上でまだ曖昧です。`uia_read_scroll_percent_at_hwnd(hwnd, axis)` のような additive napi を明記すると実装者が迷わないです。"

All four findings are accepted. The Round 1 verdict over-claimed phase correlation as a single primitive that solves both translation detection and local-repaint detection; collapsed scroll/click/keyboard into one primitive (whereas click/keyboard are local-repaint problems, fundamentally different from scroll's global translation); and centred the design on a single pre/post pair when the right architecture is a multi-frame ring buffer.

---

## 9. Round 2 — A2 framework: Temporal Motion Observation Layer

Rename Path A to **A2 — Temporal Motion Observation Layer (TMOL)**. The framework is a *layered observation pipeline*, not a single algorithm. Each layer is a candidate implementation that plugs into a stable contract; layers are stacked highest-confidence-first.

### 9.1 Architecture (single contract, pluggable implementations)

```
verifyVisualMotion(
  leafHwnd,
  region,
  axisHint?: "vertical" | "horizontal" | null,
  capability: "scroll_translation" | "local_repaint" | "any_change",
): VisualMotionObservation
```

`VisualMotionObservation`:
```ts
{
  motion: "translation" | "local_repaint" | "no_change" | "indeterminate";
  // Present when the algorithm produced a numeric shift (e.g. UIA percent for
  // source: "uia_scroll_percent"); may be absent for sources that produce
  // only a binary motion verdict (e.g. source: "temporal_ring_observation_only").
  // Sub-pixel possible. ADR-019 Stage 2b sub-plan §2.4 Option A — `shift` is
  // present when measurable; `motion` is present always.
  shift?: { dx: number; dy: number; confidence: number };
  // Present when the algorithm measured a local repaint signature (e.g.
  // SSIM residual fraction for source: "ssim_residual"); may be absent for
  // sources that produce only a binary motion verdict (sub-plan §2.4 Option A
  // relaxation, same rationale as `shift?` above).
  residual?: { fractionChanged: number; centroid?: { x: number; y: number } };
  // metadata
  source: "uia_scroll_percent" | "block_motion_vectors" | "tiled_phase_correlation"
         | "ssim_residual" | "dxgi_dirty_rect" | "optical_flow"
         | "temporal_ring_observation_only" | "chain_trust_unverified";
  framesSampled: number;
  totalElapsedMs: number;
}
```

The dispatcher picks layers based on `capability`:

| Capability | Primary layer | Fallback chain |
|---|---|---|
| `scroll_translation` (scroll dispatcher) | UIA `ScrollPattern.VerticalScrollPercent` if exposed | block motion vectors → tiled phase correlation → SSIM residual → chain_trust_unverified |
| `local_repaint` (click verify, BG keyboard verify) | SSIM residual on focused element rect (if known) | block motion vectors with `dy=0` constraint → optical flow sparse → chain_trust_unverified |
| `any_change` (general verifyDelivery) | DXGI Desktop Duplication dirty/move rect (if available) | block motion vectors → SSIM residual → chain_trust_unverified |

### 9.2 Multi-frame ring buffer (the north-star part)

This is the architectural feature the user named as the load-bearing piece. Instead of "capture pre, post, compare":

1. Capture `pre` snapshot right before the dispatch action.
2. Issue the action (PostMessage / SendInput / CDP / UIA).
3. Sample `post` frames at `t = 30, 60, 120, 240 ms` (4 frames; cap total settle at 240 ms).
4. **Decision rule**: motion observed iff `∃ post_frame ∈ ring such that motion(pre, post_frame) ≥ threshold` AND `post_frame_last` is stable (within `noise_threshold` of `post_frame_last - 1`).

The dual condition ("motion → settle → final-differs-from-pre") catches:
- **GPU staleness** — `PrintWindow` at t=30 ms returns the pre-paint cached frame; t=120 ms returns the post-paint. Without the ring buffer, we'd capture only t=30 and miss the real change.
- **Transient animations** (cursor blink, marching-ants, hover effects) — motion observed in middle frames but final frame matches pre → reject as transient noise, not a real delivery.
- **Real scrolls** — motion observed AND final frame differs from pre by the same shift → accept.

This is what the user named "動画エンコード的な" — analogous to I/P/B inter-frame coding's residual + motion compensation, applied to UI-state verification rather than video compression.

### 9.3 Candidate implementations per primitive

For `scroll_translation` (priority order):

1. **UIA `CurrentVerticalScrollPercent`** — exact, when exposed. Probe required (see §10 OQ1).
2. **Block motion vectors (16×16 SAD coarse-to-fine)** — robust to Excel periodic grid because each 16×16 block carries enough local structure to register a `dy`. Majority vote across all blocks gives the global scroll amount. Already partially implemented in `src/pixel_diff.rs` (SSE2 SAD on 8×8 blocks); extending to 16×16 with `(dx, dy)` search radius ±row_height is a moderate Rust addition.
3. **Tiled phase correlation** — `rustfft` on each of N tiles (e.g. 4×4 grid of 64×64 tiles), majority vote on `dy`. Robust against the periodic-grid-vs-row-header pathology because each tile sees mixed-frequency local content. Cost: 16 FFTs vs Round 1's 1 FFT. Still under 20 ms on 1080p with rustfft SIMD.
4. **SSIM residual map** — Wang et al. 2004 metric; converts to a "did this region change" signal. Used as a confidence floor (if SSIM ≥ 0.99 everywhere → no_change regardless of motion-vector noise).
5. **DXGI Desktop Duplication dirty/move rects** — Windows-native OS-level frame-diff metadata. Captured by the OS-side compositor, not by our PrintWindow. Highly accurate but tied to the desktop-duplication surface, not a single window. Suitable for full-screen / multi-window observation; integration is heavier (DXGI desktop duplication session lifecycle).

For `local_repaint` (click verify, BG keyboard verify):

1. **SSIM residual on focused-element rect** — the click's expected effect is a local visual change inside a known rect (the clicked element's UIA bounds). SSIM there gives a clean delta.
2. **Block motion vectors constrained to `dy=0`** — for click feedback (highlight, focus rectangle), the "movement" is a content change without translation. Block-SAD with `dy=0` (or ε bound) captures this as a residual term.
3. **Optical flow (Lucas-Kanade sparse)** — generic; samples N sparse feature points, computes per-point flow. Lower priority — block motion + SSIM cover most cases.

For `any_change` (general verifyDelivery):

1. **DXGI Desktop Duplication dirty/move rects** — best signal when available; OS knows authoritatively what changed.
2. **Block motion vectors** + **SSIM residual map** — software-only fallback when DXGI not in scope (or window not on the primary desktop).

### 9.4 phase correlation, properly gated

The original Round 1 framing was "phase correlation peak amplitude > 0.05 → motion." That's insufficient on Excel-class periodic grids. Round 2 gating:

```
phase_correlation_pass(pre, post):
  let (peak1_loc, peak1_val) = argmax(crossspec_inverse(pre, post))
  let peak2_val = max(crossspec_inverse(pre, post) \ neighbourhood(peak1_loc))
  let ratio = peak1_val / peak2_val           // ≥ 3 → confident peak
  let texture = variance(pre)                  // ≥ noise_floor → enough texture
  let tile_agreement = ratio_of_tiles_with_same_dy   // ≥ 0.5 → coherent shift
  return ratio ≥ 3 AND texture ≥ noise_floor AND tile_agreement ≥ 0.5
```

Tile agreement is the load-bearing add. A single FFT on a 256×256 patch of Excel's row-header strip can produce ambiguous peaks; computing per-tile correlation and requiring a majority of tiles to agree on the same `(dx, dy)` distinguishes "genuine global shift" from "ambiguous low-texture pattern match."

References: Guizar-Sicairos et al. 2008 (sub-pixel phase correlation via local oversampling) — the canonical algorithm for the high-confidence peak detection.

### 9.5 Concrete UIA napi (P2 finding 4)

Add to `src/uia/scroll.rs`:

```rust
#[napi]
pub fn uia_read_scroll_percent_at_hwnd(
  hwnd: BigInt,
  axis: String,  // "vertical" | "horizontal"
) -> napi::Result<Option<f64>>;
```

Implementation: `ElementFromHandle(hwnd)` → walk UIA ancestors via `RawViewWalker` looking for `IUIAutomationScrollPattern` → if found, read `CurrentVerticalScrollPercent` / `CurrentHorizontalScrollPercent` → return as `Option<f64>` (None when no pattern). Read-only; no `SetScrollPercent` side effect.

This is the additive observation API the dispatcher consults *before* falling through to block motion / phase correlation. The existing `uia_scroll_by_wheel_at_hwnd` (Tier 1 dispatch) is a *write* path; this is its read-only sibling.

### 9.6 Renamed envelope shape

ADR-018 §2.6.2 reason taxonomy is unchanged. The new envelope field is `verifyDelivery.observation`:

```
verifyDelivery: {
  status: "delivered" | "not_delivered" | "unverifiable";
  channel: "uia" | "cdp" | "postmessage" | "send_input";
  reason: …;                       // existing
  observation?: {                  // additive, optional
    source: "uia_scroll_percent" | "block_motion_vectors" | "tiled_phase_correlation"
           | "ssim_residual" | "dxgi_dirty_rect" | "optical_flow"
           | "temporal_ring_observation_only" | "chain_trust_unverified";
    shift?: { dx: number; dy: number; confidence: number };
    residual?: { fractionChanged: number };
    framesSampled?: number;
  };
}
```

Existing callers that ignore `observation` are unaffected.

## 10. Recommended pathway (Phase 5+N+1, Round 2)

**Land in stages — not one PR.** The TMOL framework's surface is too large for one PR; the user's framing requires building the *primitive*, which is multiple sub-PRs:

### Stage 1 — UIA observation read-only API (1 PR, ~1-2 days)

- Add `uia_read_scroll_percent_at_hwnd(hwnd, axis)` napi in `src/uia/scroll.rs` per §9.5.
- Wire into `postWheelToHwnd` chain-trust path: pre-snapshot the percent, post-snapshot after settle, compare against `SCROLL_PERCENT_EPSILON`. When pattern exposed AND moved → emit `delivered_via_postmessage` with `observation.source: "uia_scroll_percent"`. When pattern not exposed → fall through to Stage 2 (or chain-trust if Stage 2 not yet landed).
- Empirical probe: does EXCEL7 expose `ScrollPattern` for reads? If yes, this single stage resolves Excel observation without any image processing.
- Carry-over: `mouse_click.verifyDelivery` / `keyboard` BG verify can reuse the read-only UIA percent for any element that exposes ScrollPattern in its ancestor chain.

### Stage 2 — Multi-frame ring buffer + block motion vectors (1 PR, ~3-4 days)

- Add `captureMultiFrameRing(hwnd, region, schedule: number[])` in `src/engine/layer-buffer.ts` — captures `pre + post[]` at the requested ms offsets, returns the ring as a typed array.
- Add `computeBlockMotion(pre, post, blockSize, searchRadius)` in `src/pixel_diff.rs` (Rust SSE2 extension of existing block-SAD). Returns per-block `(dx, dy)` + a global vote.
- Wire into `postWheelToHwnd` chain-trust path: capture ring → for each post-frame, compute motion vs pre → return motion observed when (a) ≥ 1 post-frame shows coherent shift AND (b) the last post-frame is stable (within noise) → emit `delivered_via_postmessage` with `observation.source: "block_motion_vectors"` and `shift: { dx, dy }`.
- Excel periodic-grid case: 16×16 blocks each carry enough local structure for unambiguous `dy` register; majority vote across blocks gives the row count. Empirical bench required to confirm `0.36% byte change` translates to a non-zero majority vote.

### Stage 3 — Tiled phase correlation (1 PR, ~2-3 days)

- Add `rustfft` Rust crate; new `src/image/phase_correlation.rs` module with the proper gating from §9.4 (peak/secondPeak ratio, texture floor, tile agreement).
- Wire as a fallback under block motion: when block-motion's majority vote has low confidence (e.g., tile agreement < 0.5), invoke tiled phase correlation as the higher-resolution disambiguator.
- Out-of-scope: full-window single FFT (the Round 1 framing) — explicitly rejected in favour of tiled.

### Stage 4 — SSIM residual map for click/keyboard verify (1 PR, ~2-3 days)

- Different primitive from scroll's "did it translate?". SSIM detects "did the focused-element rect change."
- Wire into `mouse_click.verifyDelivery` and `keyboard` BG verify. **Not in the scroll path.**
- This is the click/keyboard generalization that Round 1 conflated with phase correlation; Round 2 cleanly separates it.

### Stage 5 — DXGI Desktop Duplication dirty/move rects (1 PR, ~5-7 days, exploratory)

- Tied to the desktop-duplication surface; integration is heavier than the per-window paths above.
- Carry-over: not blocking scroll/click verification; investigate as a Phase 5+N+2 carry-over.

### Stage 6 — Optical flow (defer until Stage 1-4 telemetry)

- Lucas-Kanade sparse / Farneback dense. Generic visual-state-change observation. Likely overkill for scroll/click/keyboard once Stages 1-4 are wired.
- Defer to telemetry-driven decision.

### What lands first

**Stage 1 alone resolves Excel observation if EXCEL7 exposes ScrollPattern for reads** — empirical probe is the gating step. If yes, Stages 2-6 become optional optimisations for non-UIA-friendly apps. If no, Stage 2 becomes the primary work, with Stage 1 as the lightweight pre-check.

Recommended ordering: **Stage 1 → empirical probe → decide Stage 2 priority based on outcome.**

---

## 11. Round 2 — Trade-offs explicitly accepted

By adopting A2 over Path A Round 1:

- **Larger scope** (5 stages vs. 1 PR), but each stage is independently shippable and provides observable LLM-side capability. Reflects the user's "system-wide" framing.
- **No single "phase correlation = solved" bet.** The framework lists 6 candidate implementations across 3 primitives (`scroll_translation` / `local_repaint` / `any_change`), each chosen for its specific failure mode.
- **Multi-frame ring buffer is central**, not optional. This was the user's named load-bearing architectural feature.
- **Click / keyboard primitive is `local_repaint`, not `scroll_translation`** — explicit primitive split.

By NOT adopting Path A Round 1 (single-FFT phase correlation):

- We give up the "single elegant primitive" framing. The Round 1 framing was simpler but conflated translation and local-repaint detection — a category error the user flagged.

By NOT adopting Path B:

- Path B's `computeChangeFraction` + `findNewRows` is folded into A2 Stage 2 as the **starting point** for block motion vectors. The existing helper is the foundation; the extension is the per-block `(dx, dy)` search.

By NOT adopting Path C:

- Same as Round 1: pHash structurally aliases on periodic grids.

---

## 12. Round 2 — Open questions

1. **Does EXCEL7 expose `IUIAutomationScrollPattern` for reads?** Empirical probe needed before Stage 1 implementation. If yes, Stage 1 alone resolves Excel; if no, Stage 2 becomes primary.
2. **Block motion vector latency budget** on 1080p windows — bench `pre + 4 post-frames @ 30/60/120/240 ms` capture + per-frame 16×16 block SAD on a 889×400 region. If > 50 ms p99, downsample to 444×200 first.
3. **Multi-frame ring buffer trigger conditions** — how aggressive should the schedule be? `[30, 60, 120, 240]` is a starting point; settling apps (Excel) may need `[30, 60, 120, 240, 500]`; over-aggressive scheduling wastes capture cost.
4. **DXGI Desktop Duplication scope** — does it fit our per-window observation model, or is it strictly a screen-wide signal? Separate ADR likely.
5. **Click / keyboard primitive boundary** — for click verification, the "focused-element rect" isn't always knowable (e.g., custom-paint canvas like Photoshop). SSIM on the full window rect is the fallback; calibrate threshold.
6. **Phase correlation gating params** — `peak/secondPeak ≥ 3`, `texture ≥ noise_floor`, `tile_agreement ≥ 0.5` are rule-of-thumb thresholds; per-app empirical calibration needed.

---

## 13. Final recommendation (Round 2)

**Adopt A2 — Temporal Motion Observation Layer (TMOL)** as the Phase 5+N+1 verification framework. Five stages, each independently shippable, with Stage 1 (read-only UIA `ScrollPercent`) as the empirical probe and likely-sufficient fix for Excel scroll observation. The multi-frame ring buffer is the architectural backbone (user's "動画エンコード的な"). Scroll uses `scroll_translation` primitive (block motion / tiled phase correlation); click/keyboard use `local_repaint` primitive (SSIM residual). Phase correlation is one implementation candidate inside `scroll_translation`, properly gated with peak/secondPeak ratio + tile agreement, NOT a stand-alone primitive.

Open Stage 1 as the next PR after user approval of this revised analysis. The empirical probe (does EXCEL7 expose `ScrollPattern` for reads?) decides the priority of Stage 2+.
