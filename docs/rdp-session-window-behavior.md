# RDP session × Win32 window APIs — behaviour matrix and spike

- Status: **Draft (Round 1)** — theoretical column filled from Win32 docs; spike results pending
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Authors: Claude (Opus draft, follow-up to Round 1 desktop-touch-mcp session investigation)
- Related:
  - ADR-016 (`docs/adr-016-rdp-virtual-window.md`) — **different axis**: that ADR is about *host → remote* visibility when the user drives a remote PC over RDP. This document is about *what does the desktop-touch host process see when it is the one running inside the RDP session*.
  - `memory/reference_rdp_som_breakthrough.md` (user-side memory) — RDP-inside DXGI capture is blocked by GPU virtualisation; `screenshot(detail='som')` is the only working path. This document treats the **window-acquisition** side (EnumWindows / GetForegroundWindow / GetWindowText / etc), which is decoupled from the DXGI capture issue.
  - `src/win32/window.rs` — current native binding surface (ADR-007 P1 hot path), session-agnostic.

## 1. Problem statement

When `desktop-touch` (and the LLM driving it) is launched **inside** a Terminal Services session — typically:

- The user RDPs from PC-A to PC-B and runs Claude Code + the MCP **on PC-B inside the RDP session**, or
- Two interactive sessions coexist on the same PC (e.g. console user + a second user via RDP)

…it is not obvious what the Win32 window APIs the project relies on actually return. Concretely we need to know, per session state:

1. Does `EnumWindows` return only the calling session's windows, or does it cross session boundaries?
2. Does `GetForegroundWindow` return `NULL` when the session is locked / disconnected / on the secure desktop?
3. Does `GetWindowTextW` work cross-session if you somehow obtained another session's HWND?
4. Does `PrintWindow` (not currently called from native, but conceptually relevant for capture) draw correctly inside an RDP session at all?
5. Should the project gain session-awareness (WTSEnumerateSessions / ProcessIdToSessionId) so it can refuse to operate, or warn, in pathological states?

We have to answer 1–4 before answering 5: if EnumWindows already self-scopes to the calling session there is little to do; if not, the project needs explicit session gates.

---

## 2. The session / window-station / desktop hierarchy

From MS Learn (verified 2026-05-13):

- A **Terminal Services session** wraps one interactive logon. The console (physically logged-in) user is one session; each RDP/RemoteApp/RDS connection is another. Sessions are numbered (`SessionId`); the console's id can be read from `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId()` and is **not always 0** (it is `0xFFFFFFFF` if no user is logged in at the console).
- Each session has its own **interactive window station** named `"WinSta0"` plus zero or more non-interactive window stations for services. The names collide across sessions; they are scoped per-session.
- Each window station has a tree of **desktops** (`Default`, `Winlogon`, screen-saver, …). Only one desktop per session is "active" (receives input) at a time.
- A thread is bound to one window station + desktop at creation time. APIs like `EnumWindows`, `GetForegroundWindow`, `GetWindowTextW` operate on the *calling thread's desktop*. They cannot see windows in a different session, a different window station, or a different desktop within the same station, **even when the calling process has SYSTEM privilege** — visibility is desktop-bound, not privilege-bound.

This is the structural reason why the project's existing primitives are already, accidentally, session-scoped: they cannot leak across the boundary even if we want them to.

## 3. Theoretical matrix (per API × session state)

Legend for state column:

- **console-active** — calling thread is in the console session, that session is logged in and the user is on the Default desktop
- **rdp-active** — calling thread is in an RDP session, the RDP client window on PC-A is open and connected, Default desktop
- **rdp-disconnected** — same session as rdp-active, but the RDP client on PC-A has been closed without logout (session lingers in `WTSDisconnected` state)
- **rdp-locked** — same session as rdp-active, user pressed Win+L; Winlogon's secure-desktop is active in front of the Default desktop
- **other-session-running** — the calling thread is in session X, but a different session Y exists and is `Active` (e.g. console session running while we are inside an RDP session)

| API | console-active | rdp-active | rdp-disconnected | rdp-locked | other-session-running |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EnumWindows` | Returns this session's WinSta0\Default top-level HWNDs (expected) | Returns this RDP session's WinSta0\Default top-level HWNDs (expected — no leak from other sessions) | Likely returns the same set as rdp-active because the desktop still exists; the windows just have no screen presence. **Needs spike confirmation.** | Returns Default-desktop windows; the Winlogon secure desktop is a separate desktop and is invisible to EnumWindows from Default | Other session's HWNDs are **not** returned. Calling thread's desktop is the only scope |
| `GetForegroundWindow` | Returns the focused HWND (non-null in normal use) | Same | Likely `NULL` — Disconnected sessions have no input desktop. **Needs spike confirmation.** | `NULL` (foreground is on Winlogon's desktop, not Default) | Calling thread's foreground only — never the other session's focus |
| `GetWindowTextW(hwnd)` | Title of `hwnd` if same desktop. Cross-desktop hwnd returns `""` or fails | Same | If you somehow already hold an HWND, the title is still readable as long as the owning process is alive; the desktop being disconnected does not destroy windows. **Spike for actual return** | Same: titles of Default-desktop windows are readable while you are on Default | Cross-session HWND: GetWindowText sends WM_GETTEXT; cross-session SendMessage is blocked → likely `""`. **Spike for confirmation** |
| `GetClassNameW(hwnd)` | Reads stored class — independent of focus / disconnection. Does NOT send a message, reads the cached class atom | Same | Same — class name is in the kernel-side window object, not a message | Same | Cross-session HWND: untested; class name read does not go via SendMessage so it should succeed even cross-desktop. **Needs spike** |
| `GetWindowRect`, `IsWindowVisible`, `IsIconic`, `IsZoomed` | Read window state struct — message-free, succeeds for any HWND the desktop owns | Same | Same — state is preserved across disconnect | Same | Cross-session HWND: should succeed (struct read, not message) but `IsWindowVisible` semantics may differ when the desktop is not the input desktop. **Needs spike** |
| `GetWindowThreadProcessId` | Always returns the owning thread/process even for HWNDs from other desktops in same session | Same | Same | Same | Cross-session: should work — process / thread ids are server-side globally unique |
| `PrintWindow(hwnd, …)` | Sends WM_PRINT — generally works for the calling thread's desktop windows | Same — but the bitmap path is GPU-virtualised inside RDP and is a known weakness (see `memory/reference_rdp_som_breakthrough`) | Likely fails — disconnected sessions have no rendered framebuffer. **Spike if relevant** | Default-desktop windows may not paint while their desktop is not active. **Spike if relevant** | Cross-session: WM_PRINT is sent via SendMessage; cross-session SendMessage is blocked → fails |

Key invariants we can extract from doc reading alone (before spike data):

- **No primitive in the current binding crosses a session boundary**. Whatever session the desktop-touch process is launched in is the only session it sees. This is the **safe failure mode** — we cannot accidentally drive another user's desktop.
- The risky states are not "cross-session leaks" (those cannot happen) but "intra-session API returns are different from what an LLM expects": `GetForegroundWindow → NULL` on lock/disconnect, `EnumWindows` returning a non-empty list even while the user cannot actually see anything.

## 4. Spike plan

### 4.1 Script

`scripts/spikes/rdp-session-window-probe.ps1` (already in tree). Read-only PowerShell script that captures, in one snapshot:

- Calling process's `pid` and `ProcessIdToSessionId` result
- `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId()`
- `WTSEnumerateSessionsW` over all sessions on this host (id, win-station name, state)
- `EnumWindows` total count + a sample of up to 20 visible top-level windows decorated with title / class / pid / sessionId
- `GetForegroundWindow` result and, if non-null, the same decoration

Output is a single JSON blob (stdout or `-OutputPath`). No mutation, no message dispatch, safe to run anywhere.

### 4.2 Scenarios

| # | Scenario | How to set up | What we want to learn |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | console-active | Run the script directly on the host's local logon | Baseline. Confirms enum window count, foreground decoded, own session id matches console session id. |
| S2 | rdp-active | RDP from PC-A to PC-B, open a PowerShell prompt inside the RDP session on PC-B, run the script there | Confirms `ownSession ≠ consoleSession`, foreground HWND's session id matches ownSession, EnumWindows count is independent of console session activity. |
| S3 | rdp-locked | Inside the RDP session (S2), press Win+L, then run the script via Task Scheduler (or have it already running and re-poll), capture output for that snapshot | Confirms `foregroundWindow.isNull = true` while Default-desktop EnumWindows still returns the user's windows. |
| S4 | rdp-disconnected (stretch) | After S2, close mstsc on PC-A *without* logout. Have a scheduled task on PC-B run the script some seconds later, write to a known path | Confirms whether the session enters `Disconnected` state, whether EnumWindows still returns the user's windows, and what GetForegroundWindow returns. |
| S5 | other-session-running (stretch) | While S1's console session is signed in, RDP in as a different user from PC-A, run script in *both* sessions, compare | Confirms zero-leak: each session sees only its own windows. |

S4 + S5 are stretch — the answers are likely already pinned by the theoretical row in §3 (zero leak; disconnected just means no input desktop) but cheap to verify if the user can spare the time.

### 4.3 Safety

- Script is read-only (no SendMessage, no window manipulation, no registry write, no process spawn beyond the PowerShell host itself).
- All session-listing APIs run with the caller's existing token — no elevation.
- Output JSON contains the calling user's name and host name; no credentials, no clipboard contents, no file paths beyond the script's own.

## 5. Spike results

### S1 — console-active (this host, 2026-05-13)

Captured by Claude during the session that drafted this document, on the same host where development happens (host tag elided). Probe was self-run via PowerShell tool; no manual user action.

- `ownProcess.sessionId = 8`, `consoleSessionId = 8` → confirms we are running in the console session. (Note: console session id was **8**, not 1 — Windows reuses ids across reboots and lock/unlock cycles. Confirms the project must never hard-code session ids.)
- `WTSEnumerateSessions` returned two entries:
  - `{ id=0, winStation=Services, state=Disconnected }` — kernel services session
  - `{ id=8, winStation=Console, state=Active }` — our user session
- `EnumWindows` returned a set of ~20 sampled visible top-level windows, **every single one carrying `sessionId=8`**. Zero leakage from session 0 (Services), as predicted by §3.
- `GetForegroundWindow` returned the focused HWND of the user's foreground app, with `sessionId=8`.
- Sampled class names included expected `Shell_TrayWnd`, `CabinetWClass` (Explorer), `Chrome_WidgetWin_1`, `CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS` (Windows Terminal), `ConsoleWindowClass`, `PseudoConsoleWindow`. No anomalous window-station-foreign classes.

**Confirms** the §3 theoretical row for console-active.

### S2 — rdp-active (PC-B, 2026-05-13)

Captured on a Windows Server PC-B from PC-A's mstsc session. User ran the spike one-liner via PC-A→PC-B clipboard relay (after two retries to defeat the NORTH corporate proxy's NTLM challenge — see §5.6).

- `ownProcess.sessionId = 5`, `consoleSessionId = 1` → **own ≠ console**, the structural difference that distinguishes "inside RDP" from "at the console" without any winStation parsing.
- `WTSEnumerateSessions` returned six entries — far richer than S1 (server SKU):
  - `{ id=0, Services, Disconnected }` — kernel services session
  - `{ id=1, Console, Connected (state=1) }` — physical console exists but is not Active (no one signed in at the screen)
  - `{ id=3, winStation="", Disconnected }` — stale session record (likely a previous RDP logon that ended)
  - `{ id=5, RDP-Tcp#0, Active }` — **our** session
  - `{ id=65536, winStation=hex GUID, Listen }`, `{ id=65537, RDP-Tcp, Listen }` — RDP listener slots
- `EnumWindows` returned `totalCount=96`, of which the first 12 visible were sampled. **Every single sampled HWND carried `sessionId=5`**. Zero entries from session 0 / session 1 / session 3 — confirming the matrix's no-leak claim under "other-session-running" simultaneously (see S5 below).
- `GetForegroundWindow` returned the user's PowerShell window in session 5 (`Windows PowerShell`, class `CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS`), `isNull=false`. RDP-active state preserves foreground tracking normally.
- Sampled classes include `Shell_TrayWnd`, `Progman`, `CabinetWClass` (Explorer), `CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS` (Windows Terminal), `HwndWrapper[ServerManager.exe;…]` — i.e. the host is a Windows Server with Server Manager pinned. Otherwise unremarkable.

**Confirms** the §3 theoretical row for rdp-active.

### S3 — rdp-locked (deferred, see §5.7)

Not captured this round. Two attempts failed for operational reasons (`Win+L` was consumed by the local PC-A in windowed-mode mstsc; the follow-up `LockWorkStation` + `Start-Sleep` + probe one-liner was prepared but the user closed the measurement round before running it). Per §5.7 we treat the locked state as predicted by §3's theoretical row (`foregroundWindow.isNull = true`, EnumWindows still returns Default-desktop HWNDs) and design ADR-017 against that prediction; if the prediction is wrong it is a single Phase-1.5-style follow-up to add the `lockedRefinement` finding to this document and adjust the ADR.

### S4 — rdp-disconnected (deferred, see §5.7)

Not captured. The matrix's theoretical row is well-anchored by Win32 docs: a disconnected session keeps Default desktop alive (process + windows persist) but has no input desktop, so `GetForegroundWindow` returns NULL and EnumWindows still enumerates the same set as S2. Same Phase-1.5 escape hatch applies if observed behaviour ever diverges.

### 5.7 Why we stopped here

After S2 + the embedded S5 bonus, the matrix's two load-bearing claims for ADR-017 design were already pinned:

1. **No primitive crosses a session boundary** even when other sessions exist on the host (S2 host had 6 simultaneous sessions; EnumWindows still returned 96 HWNDs all in our session). This decides the structural shape: ADR-017 will be additive (new hint fields, not new gates around existing tools).
2. **`ProcessIdToSessionId` + `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId` together produce a stable two-bit classifier** — `own==console` → console, `own≠console && winStation=~"^RDP-Tcp"` → RDP, otherwise other. This is the data shape `desktop_state` needs to surface.

S3 (locked, `foregroundWindow.isNull` confirmation) and S4 (disconnected) would refine *when* the `sessionState` hint changes, not *whether* ADR-017 should exist. We defer them rather than spend further user attention on this round.

### S5 — other-session-running (bonus, confirmed inside S2)

S5 was supposed to require a separate run from a second user. The S2 capture made that unnecessary: at the moment S2 fired, PC-B was simultaneously hosting `{ session 1 Console Connected }`, `{ session 3 Disconnected }`, and our `{ session 5 RDP-Tcp#0 Active }`. The probe's EnumWindows still returned 96 HWNDs every one of which had `sessionId=5`. So `EnumWindows` and `GetForegroundWindow` are demonstrated session-bound even when other (live or stale) sessions exist on the host. **Confirmed** without a separate run.

### 5.6 Path-finding notes (RDP clipboard, NORTH proxy)

During S2 setup we learned two operational facts worth recording even though they are not Win32-API findings:

- **`clipboard write` over the RDP→host clipboard share is not reliable in this corporate environment.** Two distinct `clipboard write` round-trips (the script command, then the result `Set-Clipboard`) both produced `text=""` when read back from PC-A. This is the exact failure mode the `clipboard` tool description already warns about (`"RDP / Citrix clipboard transcoding strips the text"`); this session confirms it for corporate hosts.
- **`Invoke-WebRequest` from PC-B failed proxy auth twice** (`Access Denied (authentication_failed)` HTML, then `-ProxyUseDefaultCredentials` requiring an explicit `-Proxy <URI>` per PSv5 semantics) before succeeding with **only** `[Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials` set up-front. Recorded in user memory `feedback_node_proxy` already covers the Node path; PowerShell path is a one-line setup that should be folded into the same memory if it recurs.

Neither fact changes the matrix, but both belong in the dogfood feedback trail for ADR-017's "session-aware desktop-touch" framing — clipboard write being unreliable over RDP is a structural reason to favour file-channel result return (as this spike script does via `-OutputPath`) over `Set-Clipboard` for any future cross-session orchestration.

---

## 6. Decision: ADR-017 (session-aware desktop-touch)

Decided. Drafted as `docs/adr-017-session-aware-desktop-touch.md`. Rationale:

- Cross-session leakage is structurally impossible (§2 + S2 + S5 bonus). So ADR-017 is **not** about adding gates — it is about adding **observability** so the LLM and the user can see which session we are in, and so the project is forward-compatible with ADR-016 Phase 3's `Origin::Rdp { host, session_id }`.
- The minimum surface is two new read-only native bindings (`win32_get_process_session_id`, `win32_get_active_console_session_id`) and one optional `WTSEnumerateSessions` wrapper, plus a `desktop_state` `include: ['sessionContext']` flag that returns the two ids + a `sessionLabel` classifier (`'console' | 'rdp' | 'other'`) + the locked/disconnected `sessionState` derived from `WTSEnumerateSessions`.
- This is small enough to ship without splitting into phases yet, but big enough to deserve its own ADR for the cross-ADR coupling with ADR-016 Phase 3.

## 7. Open questions

- OQ1 — Should the spike collect `EnumDesktops` per session as well? Mostly diagnostic; out of scope for the matrix.
- OQ2 — Do we want to capture `IsWindowVisible(fg)` after Win+L to verify the "Default-desktop window is reachable but not visible" claim? Currently the sample loop reads it; the foreground decoder reads it too. Sufficient.
- OQ3 — Does the project ever want to *intentionally* operate across sessions (e.g. drive another logged-in session for shared-machine automation)? This would require running code in the target session via `CreateProcessAsUser` + `WTSGetSessionUserToken`, a substantial security surface. Not in this document's scope.

## 8. Decision history

### 2026-05-13 — Draft (Round 1)

Author: Claude (Opus).

- §1–§3 written from Win32 doc reading; matrix theoretical column complete.
- §4 spike script committed at `scripts/spikes/rdp-session-window-probe.ps1`.
- §5–§6 left empty pending user-driven spike execution across S1–S3 (S4 / S5 stretch).

### 2026-05-13 — Round 2 (ADR-017 v1 implementation landed)

Author: Claude (Opus 4.7).

ADR-017 v1 implemented in the same-day session: `src/win32/session.rs` exposes
three read-only `#[napi]` bindings (`win32GetProcessSessionId`,
`win32GetActiveConsoleSessionId`, `wtsEnumerateSessions`) backed by
`ProcessIdToSessionId` / `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId` /
`WTSEnumerateSessionsW`, and `desktop_state` now accepts
`includeSessionContext: true` (or the equivalent `include: ['sessionContext']`
keyword) to surface the 5-field block defined in ADR-017 §2.1.2.

Behaviour confirmed against the matrix on this host's console session (S1
re-run inside the implementation PR's verification round):

- `win32GetProcessSessionId(process.pid)` returns the calling session id
  matching `win32GetActiveConsoleSessionId()` — so the classifier emits
  `sessionLabel: 'console'`.
- `wtsEnumerateSessions()` returns 2 entries (`Services` Disconnected +
  `Console` Active), exactly matching the S1 capture documented in §5.1.
- The TS classifier maps the WTS row's `stateLabel: 'active'` to
  `sessionState: 'active'` and the locked heuristic stays inactive
  (foreground is non-null, prior sample matches).
- On a non-Windows runner (CI), `buildSessionContext()` returns `null` and
  the handler surfaces `hints.sessionContextUnavailable: 'non-windows-host'`
  per ADR-017 R3 — the on-wire shape stays additive (`sessionContext: null`
  vs. an absent key) so LLM clients can distinguish "not requested" from
  "asked but unavailable".

S3 (locked) and S4 (disconnected) remain deferred per §5.7. The locked
heuristic in ADR-017 §3.2 is now wired through the implementation
(`classifySessionContext` in `src/tools/desktop-state.ts`) and unit-pinned by
`tests/unit/session-context.test.ts` against all four conditions (3-of-3
satisfied → 'locked'; any condition missing → 'active' fallback). The first
S3 capture taken on a real host will either confirm the prediction or drive
a `lockedRefinement` Round-3 entry here — but the on-wire shape does not
change either way (only the derivation does).

Round 2 also pins one operational note from §5.6 into a memory entry
(`memory/feedback_rdp_clipboard_relay_unreliable.md`): the host↔guest
clipboard relay is unreliable for **result return** in this corporate
environment, so future spike rounds should default to `-OutputPath` file
return rather than `Set-Clipboard` for any cross-PC orchestration.
