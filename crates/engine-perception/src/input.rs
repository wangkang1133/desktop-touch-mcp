//! L1 → engine-perception input boundary.
//!
//! ## Direction of dep
//!
//! The root crate (`desktop-touch-engine`) owns the L1 capture ring,
//! decodes `EventEnvelope` payloads, and pushes pure data into a
//! [`L1Sink`] implementation provided by this crate. The reverse
//! direction (engine-perception depending on the root crate) was
//! considered and rejected in Codex review v2 P1 — it would drag the
//! root crate's heavy compile graph (napi, ORT, tokenizers,
//! windows-rs, vision-gpu) into this crate and break the
//! "pure timely + DD compute" contract from
//! `docs/adr-008-d1-plan.md` §2.
//!
//! ## D1-2 wiring
//!
//! P5c-0b landed the trait + the `FocusEvent` data type as a stable
//! contract that the bridge in `src/l3_bridge/focus_pump.rs`
//! writes against. D1-2 fills the actual `FocusInputHandle` (the
//! `differential_dataflow::input::InputSession` wrapper) and the
//! `PerceptionWorker` (the timely worker thread that owns the
//! InputSession).
//!
//! ## Why a worker thread + command channel?
//!
//! `differential_dataflow::input::InputSession` is **thread-local** —
//! it can only be poked from inside the timely worker that built the
//! dataflow. We can't expose `&InputSession` to the bridge directly.
//! So we run the InputSession inside a dedicated worker thread and
//! feed it via a `crossbeam_channel::Sender<Cmd>`. `FocusInputHandle`
//! holds the sender; the worker holds the receiver and the
//! InputSession.
//!
//! ## Watermark semantics (北極星 N2)
//!
//! Per `docs/adr-008-d1-2-plan.md` §1.5 N2, we keep event-time as
//! data on `FocusEvent.{wallclock_ms, sub_ordinal}` and use
//! [`crate::time::LogicalTime`] for both the dataflow timestamp and
//! the timely frontier. `update_at(ev, event_time, +1)` posts each
//! event at its own logical time; `advance_to(watermark)` advances
//! the frontier to `(latest_wallclock_ms - WATERMARK_SHIFT_MS, 0)`.
//! Out-of-order events that fall within the watermark window are
//! accepted; events older than the current frontier are dropped (DD
//! would panic on `update_at` with a time below the session time —
//! we guard before calling).
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! [`spawn_perception_worker`] returns `(PerceptionWorker, FocusInputHandle)`.
//! Drop the handle (or all clones thereof) and call
//! `PerceptionWorker::shutdown(timeout)` to stop the thread.
