//! L1 → engine-perception input boundary.
//!
//! ## Direction of dep
//!
//! The root crate (`desktop-touch-engine`) owns the L1 capture ring,
//! decodes `EventEnvelope` payloads, and pushes pure data into a
//! [`L1Sink`] implementation provided by this crate. The reverse
//! direction (engine-perception depending on the root crate) was
//! considered and rejected in Codex review v2 P1 — it would drag the
//! root crate's heavy compile graph (napi, ORT, tokenizers,
//! windows-rs, vision-gpu) into this crate and break the
//! "pure timely + DD compute" contract from
//! `docs/adr-008-d1-plan.md` §2.
//!
//! ## D1-2 wiring
//!
//! P5c-0b landed the trait + the `FocusEvent` data type as a stable
//! contract that the bridge in `src/l3_bridge/focus_pump.rs`
//! writes against. D1-2 fills the actual `FocusInputHandle` (the
//! `differential_dataflow::input::InputSession` wrapper) and the
//! `PerceptionWorker` (the timely worker thread that owns the
//! InputSession).
//!
//! ## Why a worker thread + command channel?
//!
//! `differential_dataflow::input::InputSession` is **thread-local** —
//! it can only be poked from inside the timely worker that built the
//! dataflow. We can't expose `&InputSession` to the bridge directly.
//! So we run the InputSession inside a dedicated worker thread and
//! feed it via a `crossbeam_channel::Sender<Cmd>`. `FocusInputHandle`
//! holds the sender; the worker holds the receiver and the
//! InputSession.
//!
//! ## Watermark semantics (北極星 N2)
//!
//! Per `docs/adr-008-d1-2-plan.md` §1.5 N2, we keep event-time as
//! data on `FocusEvent.{wallclock_ms, sub_ordinal}` and use
//! [`crate::time::LogicalTime`] for both the dataflow timestamp and
//! the timely frontier. `update_at(ev, event_time, +1)` posts each
//! event at its own logical time; `advance_to(watermark)` advances
//! the frontier to `(latest_wallclock_ms - WATERMARK_SHIFT_MS, 0)`.
//! Out-of-order events that fall within the watermark window are
//! accepted; events older than the current frontier are dropped (DD
//! would panic on `update_at` with a time below the session time —
//! we guard before calling).
//!
//! ## Idle frontier advance (PR #91 P2)
//!
//! Real L1 capture has no heartbeat: when a user focuses a window
//! and stops, no further `UiaFocusChanged` events arrive. Without
//! intervention the dataflow's input frontier would sit at
//! `(latest_wallclock_ms - shift, 0)` forever, leaving the most
//! recent event at the frontier and never released — the view would
//! be stale for the *current* focus, the very state it's meant to
//! materialise.
//!
//! We solve this by anchoring the most recent event's wallclock_ms
//! to a real `Instant` and, in the idle branch of the worker loop,
//! projecting `latest_wallclock_ms` forward by the real elapsed time
//! since that anchor. The watermark advances accordingly. In
//! production, where L1 events carry monotone real-time wallclocks,
//! this projection is always ≤ a legitimate future event's
//! wallclock_ms, so it never causes valid later events to appear
//! back-dated relative to the frontier.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! [`spawn_perception_worker`] returns a 4-tuple
//! `(PerceptionWorker, FocusInputHandle, CurrentFocusedElementView,
//! LatestFocusView)` (D2-B-1: `LatestFocusView` added in
//! `docs/adr-008-d2-plan.md` §5.bis). Drop the handle (or all clones
//! thereof) and call `PerceptionWorker::shutdown(timeout)` to stop
//! the thread. Both view handles are independent of the worker's
//! lifetime — they remain readable after shutdown but stop
//! receiving updates.

/// Body of the timely worker thread (D2-A revised tuning).

/// Runs `timely::execute_directly` with a single-thread allocator;

/// closure returns, `execute_directly` drains remaining work before
/// the function returns.
///
/// ## Why D2-A revised tuning (vs D1's `try_recv` + 1ms sleep)
///
/// PR #92 D1-5 measurement showed `view_update_latency` p99 ~4.7 ms
/// — over the SLO `p99 < 1 ms` from `docs/views-catalog.md` §3.1.
/// Three contributing factors all on the critical path:
///
///   1. `thread::sleep(1ms)` in the `Empty` arm: cmd-arrival
///      detection takes up to 1 ms, dataflow steps interleaved with it.
///   2. DD operator chain propagation needs 2-3 `worker.step()` calls
///      (input → map → reduce → inspect). With sleeps between them
///      they accumulate.
///   3. Cmd-branch `advance_to(watermark)` puts the frontier **at**
///      event_time, not past it — DD reduce can't finalise the new
///      row's diff until the idle-advance projects past it. The
///      post-cmd Empty branch is therefore also on the critical path.
///
/// ## D2-A fix (`docs/adr-008-d2-plan.md` §4.2 v3.8)
///
/// Three changes (Codex review v8 P2-15 / v10 P1+P2 / v11 P3) that
/// reduce latency while preserving the N2 watermark-shift acceptance
/// contract and the N3 partial-order contract:
///
///   - **`recv_timeout(idle_recv_timeout)` instead of `try_recv` +
///     sleep**: the worker wakes immediately when a cmd arrives. The
///     idle-frontier-advance work moves into a timeout-driven path
///     that runs only when the channel is genuinely idle.
///   - **Batch drain + watermark-shift release**: each loop
///     iteration takes the first cmd via `recv_timeout`, then drains
///     the channel non-blockingly up to `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`. After all
///     cmds in the batch have called `update_at`, advance the frontier
///     to `watermark_for(max_observed_wallclock_ms, shift_ms)` =
///     `(max_observed_wc - shift_ms, 0)`. **This is D1's watermark
///     shift logic preserved** — release of the just-pushed event is
///     owned by the idle-advance branch (which projects
///     `latest_wallclock + real_elapsed` past the shift window).
///     An earlier v3.7 attempt advanced to
///     `(max_observed_wc, max_observed_sub_ord + 1)` to release
///     events inside the same cmd batch, but Codex v10 caught that
///     this dropped legitimate within-shift across-batch events
///     (and broke the integration test's "pump" focus pattern), so
///     v3.8 reverted to the D1 shape — see `docs/adr-008-d2-plan.md`
///     v3.8 history.
///   - **`step_until_idle` after the batch**: drain the operator
///     chain in one go (capped at `MAX_STEPS_PER_CMD`) instead of
///     stepping once per loop iteration with a sleep between.
///
/// `event_count` guards (Codex v6 P2-8 invariant 7): if the batch
/// contained only `Shutdown` (or a `BlockForTest` in tests), skip
/// `advance_to` / `flush` / `step` / `processed_count` increment.
/// Without this guard a shutdown-only batch would advance the
/// frontier past spurious data and bump the processed counter.
///
/// ## Idle-branch frontier advance (PR #91 P2 retained, refactored)
///
/// When `recv_timeout` returns `Err(Timeout)`, project
/// `latest_wallclock_ms` forward by real elapsed since the last event
/// anchor and advance the watermark accordingly. Same semantics as D1
/// — a quiescent focus still gets materialised — just driven by the
/// `recv_timeout` cycle instead of `try_recv` + `sleep`.
