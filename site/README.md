# Site Content Directory

This directory stores drafts and assets for the public-facing site.

## Purpose

- `docs/` holds design notes, research notes, and implementation planning
- `site/` holds content that is close to what readers should eventually see

This separation helps keep:

- internal planning separate from public-facing copy
- GitHub Pages and note-ready drafts easier to edit
- figures and evaluation data scoped to the site itself

## Current structure

## Publishing

The full `site/` directory is not meant to be published as-is.

- Markdown drafts and planning notes stay in the repository
- GitHub Pages publishes only the public HTML entry points and shared assets
- The publish workflow assembles a clean `_site/` artifact from:
  - `site/index.html`
  - `site/articles/*.html`
  - `site/assets/**`

The workflow file is:

- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

## Editing policy

- reader-facing writing should go into `site/` first
- design planning and comparative notes should stay in `docs/`
- page structure and copy should be stabilized here before turning them into actual site files
